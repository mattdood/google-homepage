# google-homepage
A reproduction of the Google homepage in CSS



This was assigned through The Odin Project (https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css) as an ending to the introductory HTML and CSS lessons.

This project revolved around basic styling, with minimal functionality, by utilizing the DevTools in the Chrome browser to recreate the google.com homepage.

CSS was heavily utilized in the styling of the webpage, with care taken to determine hovers, links, and near exact margins on navigation bars.
